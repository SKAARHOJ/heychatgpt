This repository contains the code created during the SKAARHOJ video series titled "Hey ChatGPT, Write Me a Raw Panel Client." 

These videos demonstrate the ease of integrating Raw Panel with your preferred programming language, using ChatGPT to quickly establish a foundational working code. Additionally, the series introduces other tools, like the Raw Panel Explorer, which aids in exploring feedback commands for the panels. 

The code in this repository remains as it was presented in the videos, without further modifications.
